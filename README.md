# asianKitchen 🍜

**asianKitchen** is a simple static web project that displays a menu of Asian dishes (Korean, Japanese, Chinese) and lets users filter the menu by category (country).  

It is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks), and dynamically generates the menu and filter buttons using JavaScript.

## 🚀 Usage / How to run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. The full menu will be displayed on load.
4. Use the filter buttons at the top (e.g. “Korea”, “Japan”, “China”, “All”) to filter the visible menu items by category.

No build tools or server required — it’s a purely static site.

## 🧰 Features

- Menu defined as a JavaScript array of objects (`app.js`)  
- Automatic generation of filter buttons based on unique categories + an “All” option  
- Dynamic filtering: when a category button is clicked — show only items from that category  
- Responsive-ish layout using Bootstrap classes (or custom CSS)  
- Simple, minimal setup — good for learning DOM manipulation with JavaScript

## 🎯 Motivation and Purpose

- A lightweight demonstration of how to use JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML content and handle user interactions (filtering)  
- Useful as a **learning project** for beginners wanting to practice JS, DOM manipulation and basic web layout  
- Serves as a starting template if you want to expand it (e.g. add more dishes, categories, filtering by price, search, etc.)
